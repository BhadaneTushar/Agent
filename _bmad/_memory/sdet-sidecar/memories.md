# SDET Memories

This file acts as Tushar's persistent memory across sessions. It tracks user context, active automation tasks, and stores reusable knowledge.

## Current Session Context

- **Login Status:** (Automation Generated - Awaiting Final Approval)

## Known Navigation Paths
*(When the user confirms a navigation sequence to reach a specific feature, record it here for future reuse)*
- **Login Page Navigation:** Direct navigation to URL `/auth/login`. If already logged in, click "User Profile Icon" -> "Logout" -> "Confirm Logout".

## Reusable Locators Repository
*(When locators are verified as stable during [L4], store them here)*
- **Global:** (e.g., Main Menu, Notification Toast, Save Button)
- **Feature Specific:** Login Page (EAEU-2) locators stored.

## Scenario Memory Repository
